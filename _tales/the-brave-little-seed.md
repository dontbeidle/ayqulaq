Deep in the dark, cool earth, a little seed lay sleeping.

All around her, other seeds were stretching and pushing, eager to grow. They shot up through the soil, reaching for the sunlight above.

But the little seed was afraid.

"It's so dark down here," she whispered. "What if it's even darker up there? What if I can't grow as tall as the others?"

---

Days passed. The other seeds became sprouts, then stems, then plants with leaves that danced in the breeze. The little seed could hear them laughing and playing above.

"Come on up!" called a sunflower. "The sun is so warm!"

"The rain is like a cool shower!" sang a tulip.

But still, the little seed stayed hidden in the earth.

One morning, a gentle earthworm wiggled by.

"Why are you still down here, little one?" he asked kindly.

"I'm scared," admitted the seed. "What if I'm not strong enough? What if I'm not beautiful like the others?"

The earthworm smiled. "Would you like to know a secret?"

The seed nodded.

> "Every flower up there was once a scared little seed, just like you. The only difference is—they decided to try."

---

The little seed thought about this for a long, long time.

Finally, she took a tiny breath and pushed—just a little.

To her surprise, it didn't hurt at all. She pushed again, a little more.

Day by day, she grew. First a root, then a tiny stem, then a leaf no bigger than a raindrop.

And then, one golden morning, she broke through the soil and felt the sunshine on her face for the very first time.

---

The other plants cheered.

"You made it!" cried the sunflower.

"Welcome!" sang the tulip.

The little seed—now a small green sprout—looked around at the beautiful garden. She felt the warm sun, the cool breeze, and the soft rain.

"I was so afraid," she said. "But it's wonderful up here."

The old oak tree nearby rustled his leaves gently. "You took your time, and that's perfectly fine. Some of us need to grow our roots before we can reach for the sky."

---

And grow she did.

By summer's end, the brave little seed had become the most beautiful wildflower in the whole garden—not because she was the tallest or the brightest, but because she had found the courage to bloom.
