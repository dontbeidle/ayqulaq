In a sunny meadow at the edge of the Whispering Woods, there lived a rabbit named Rosie.

Rosie had the most beautiful garden in all the meadow. She had fat orange carrots, crisp green lettuce, and berries as red as rubies.

But Rosie never, ever shared.

"These are MY carrots," she would say. "This is MY lettuce. Go find your own food!"

---

One cold morning, Rosie woke up to find snow covering the meadow. All the other animals were looking for food, but everything was frozen and buried.

A little mouse knocked on Rosie's door.

"Please, Rosie," squeaked the mouse. "May I have just one small berry? My children are so hungry."

"No!" said Rosie, shutting her door. "Mine, mine, mine!"

A blue bird landed on her windowsill.

"Rosie, could you spare a single seed? I haven't eaten in days."

"Absolutely not!" huffed Rosie. "Go away!"

---

That night, a terrible blizzard howled across the meadow. Rosie huddled in her burrow with her piles of food, but she didn't feel happy.

She felt cold.

Not cold from the snow—cold on the inside. Cold and alone.

She thought about the hungry mouse and her children. She thought about the shivering bird.

And for the first time, Rosie's heart felt heavy.

---

When morning came, Rosie gathered her carrots, her lettuce, and her berries into a big basket. She opened her door and stepped into the snow.

She found the mouse first. "Here," Rosie said shyly, "these are for you and your children."

The mouse's eyes grew wide. "Really? For us?"

Rosie nodded.

She found the bird next, and the squirrel, and the hedgehog, and all the other animals who had been hungry and cold.

To each one, she gave food from her garden.

---

Something strange happened as Rosie's basket grew empty. Her heart grew full.

"Thank you, Rosie!" the animals cheered.

"Will you share lunch with us?" asked the mouse.

"We're making soup!" added the bird.

"I have acorn bread!" said the squirrel.

Rosie found herself surrounded by friends, all sharing a wonderful meal together.

That day, Rosie learned something important. When she kept everything for herself, she had food but no joy. When she shared, she had both.

---

And from that day on, Rosie's garden became the gathering place for all the animals in the meadow. There was always enough for everyone—and there was always laughter.

Because the funny thing about sharing, Rosie discovered, is that it doesn't make you have less.

It makes you have more.
