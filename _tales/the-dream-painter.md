High above the clouds, in a castle made of moonbeams, there lived a little painter named Aria.

But Aria wasn't an ordinary painter. She painted dreams.

Every night, while children slept, Aria dipped her silver brush into jars of starlight and painted wonderful dreams. Flying dreams and funny dreams, adventure dreams and silly dreams.

She loved her job very much.

---

One night, Aria received a special request from the Dream Queen.

"There is a little boy named Theo," said the Queen. "He hasn't dreamed in many, many nights. He's forgotten how to imagine."

Aria was worried. "What if I can't help him?"

The Dream Queen smiled gently. "Just paint from your heart."

That night, Aria flew down from the clouds on her moonbeam sleigh. She found Theo's window and peeked inside.

Theo was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling. His room was very neat and organized, with everything in perfect rows.

"Hmm," thought Aria. "This boy needs some color."

She dipped her brush into the brightest jar of starlight and began to paint.

First, she painted a tiny purple dragon that swooped around Theo's room.

Theo blinked. Was that... a dragon?

Aria painted a forest of candy canes. A river made of chocolate. A mountain of pillows that touched the sky.

Then she painted something special—a pair of wings on Theo's back.

In his dream, Theo rose from his bed. He looked at the magical world around him and laughed.

"I'm flying!" he cried. "This is amazing!"

He soared through cotton-candy clouds and played tag with the purple dragon. He slid down rainbow slides and bounced on marshmallow trampolines.

When morning came, Theo woke with a big smile on his face.

He looked at his neat, organized room—and suddenly, it seemed too empty.

He grabbed paper and crayons and began to draw. A purple dragon. A candy-cane forest. All the wonderful things he'd seen in his dream.

His mother found him surrounded by colorful drawings, laughing as he created a whole new world.

"Theo!" she said. "You're drawing again!"

"I had the most amazing dream, Mom," said Theo. "And I want to remember it forever."

---

Up in her moonbeam castle, Aria smiled as she watched through her magic mirror.

"He did it," she whispered happily. "He remembered how to imagine."

That night, Aria painted extra-special dreams for Theo—not because he needed help anymore, but because he had become her favorite dreamer.

And every morning, Theo woke up ready to create new wonders of his own.

After all, the best dreams don't just happen at night.

They happen whenever you dare to imagine.
