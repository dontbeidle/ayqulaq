Long, long ago, when the night sky was still new, the Moon lived all alone in the great darkness above the world.

The Moon was beautiful—round and silver and glowing with soft light. But she was lonely. Every night she would drift across the sky by herself, watching the sleeping world below.

"How I wish I had a friend," she sighed.

One evening, a tiny spark appeared beside her. It flickered and danced, no bigger than a firefly.

"Hello," said the spark. "My name is Star. I'm very small, but may I keep you company?"

The Moon smiled warmly. "Of course! But aren't you too little to stay up here in the big sky?"

Star twinkled bravely. "I may be small, but my light is true."

Night after night, Star stayed by the Moon's side. They told stories and sang songs, and the Moon was no longer lonely.

Then something wonderful happened.

Other tiny sparks saw how happy Star was with the Moon. One by one, they came to join their friend. Soon there were ten stars, then a hundred, then more than anyone could count.

> "Look," whispered Star to the Moon. "You're not alone anymore."

The Moon gazed at the thousands of stars twinkling all around her, and her heart filled with joy.

"You were just one small star," she said. "How did you bring me so many friends?"

Star sparkled brightly. "When you share your light with kindness, others want to share theirs too."

And so it is, to this very day.

When you look up at the night sky, you will see the Moon glowing softly, surrounded by countless stars—all friends, all shining together.

And if you look very carefully, you might see one star twinkling just a little brighter than the rest.

That's the first Star, still keeping the Moon company, just as she promised.
