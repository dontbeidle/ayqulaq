On a rocky cliff overlooking the wild sea, there lived an old lighthouse keeper named Marina.

Every night, Marina climbed the winding stairs to light the great lamp at the top of the tower. Its golden beam swept across the dark waters, guiding ships safely home.

"Shine bright, old friend," Marina would whisper to the lamp. "Someone out there needs your light."

---

One stormy autumn evening, as rain lashed against the windows and thunder shook the sky, Marina heard a small knock at her door.

She opened it to find a young girl, soaking wet and shivering, with eyes as grey as the storm clouds.

"Please," the girl said, "I'm lost. I can't find my way home."

Marina wrapped the girl in a warm blanket and sat her by the fire. She made hot cocoa and told her stories of the sea while the storm raged outside.

"What's your name, child?" Marina asked.

"Lily," said the girl. "My mother always says to look for the lighthouse when I'm lost. She says its light will lead me home."

When the storm finally passed, Marina walked Lily down the cliff path to the village below. There, Lily's mother ran to meet them, tears of joy on her face.

"Thank you," she said, embracing Marina. "Thank you for taking care of my daughter."

Marina smiled. "It's what the lighthouse is for—guiding those who are lost back to safety."

That night, as Marina climbed the stairs to light the lamp, she noticed something different. In the village below, a single candle appeared in a window. Then another. And another.

---

Lily had told everyone in the village about the kind lighthouse keeper. Now, whenever Marina lit the great lamp, the villagers lit candles in their windows—small lights answering her big one.

"Look at that," Marina whispered, gazing at the twinkling village. "My one light has become many."

From then on, no matter how dark the night or fierce the storm, the coast was bright with light—the lighthouse above, and the candles below.

---

Years later, when Marina was very old, young Lily climbed the winding stairs herself. She had become the new lighthouse keeper.

As she lit the lamp for the first time, she remembered the old woman's words.

"Shine bright, old friend," Lily whispered. "Someone out there needs your light."

And down in the village, hundreds of candles flickered to life, answering her call.
